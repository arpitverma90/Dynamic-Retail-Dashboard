### **Problem Statements Solved with Steps**

#### 1. **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**
   - **Objective**: Dynamically display key metrics such as Total Sales, Total Profit, Total Quantity, Number of Orders, and Profit Margin.
   
   **Steps**:
   - Import the **Orders Table** using **Power Query**.
   - Create calculated columns for:
     - **Profit Margin**: `Profit / Sales`.
     - **Total Orders**: `Count of Order ID`.
   - Use Excel formulas to calculate:
     - **Total Sales**: `=SUM(Sales)`.
     - **Total Profit**: `=SUM(Profit)`.
     - **Total Quantity**: `=SUM(Quantity)`.
   - Create a dynamic KPI table with visual elements like symbols (e.g., ðŸ’° for Total Sales).

---

#### 2. **Sales and Profit Analysis**
   - **Objective**: Track and visualize sales and profit trends over time.
   
   **Steps**:
   - Create a **Pivot Table** with `Order Date` grouped by Year and Month.
   - Add **Sales** and **Profit** as values.
   - Create a **Line Chart** to display trends.
   - Apply **Slicers** to filter data dynamically by category, market, or region.

---

#### 3. **Category-Wise Profit**
   - **Objective**: Evaluate profit across different product categories.
   
   **Steps**:
   - Create a **Pivot Table** using `Category` as rows and `Profit` as values.
   - Sort the table in descending order of Profit.
   - Create a **Bar Chart** to display the category-wise profit.
   - Use **Slicers** for interactive filtering by region or year.

---

#### 4. **Segment-Wise Sales Share (%)**
   - **Objective**: Visualize the sales share for each customer segment.
   
   **Steps**:
   - Create a **Pivot Table** with `Segment` as rows and `Sales` as values.
   - Calculate **Percentage Share**: `=Sales / Total Sales * 100`.
   - Use a **Pie** or **Donut Chart** to present the share visually.
   - Add **Labels** to show percentage values dynamically.

---

#### 5. **Sales by Country**
   - **Objective**: Examine sales performance by country.
   
   **Steps**:
   - Create a **Pivot Table** with `Country` as rows and `Sales` as values.
   - Sort the table in descending order of Sales.
   - Use **Conditional Formatting** or a **Heatmap** to highlight top-performing countries.
   - Alternatively, use a **Geographic Map Chart** to visualize sales geographically.

---

#### 6. **Top 5 Subcategories**
   - **Objective**: Identify the top 5 performing subcategories based on sales.
   
   **Steps**:
