### **Problem Statements Solved with Steps**

#### 1. **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**
   - **Objective**: Dynamically display key metrics such as Total Sales, Total Profit, Total Quantity, Number of Orders, and Profit Margin.
   
   **Steps**:
   - Import the **Orders Table** using **Power Query**.
   - Create calculated columns for:
     - **Profit Margin**: `Profit / Sales`.
     - **Total Orders**: `Count of Order ID`.
   - Use Excel formulas to calculate:
     - **Total Sales**: `=SUM(Sales)`.
     - **Total Profit**: `=SUM(Profit)`.
     - **Total Quantity**: `=SUM(Quantity)`.
     - ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0bcc10ed-26c1-4a80-bf07-68340ba76885)


   - Create a dynamic KPI table with visual elements like symbols (e.g., ðŸ’° for Total Sales).
   - Here is the KPI table you requested in a simple table format:

| **Name**           | **Metric**             | **Symbol** |
|--------------------|------------------------|------------|
| **Total Sales**     | Sum of Sales           | ðŸ’°         |
| **Total Profit**    | Sum of Profit          | ðŸ“ˆ         |
| **Total Quantity**  | Sum of Quantity        | ðŸ“¦         |
| **No. of Orders**   | Count of Order ID      | ðŸ›’         |
| **Profitability**   | Sum of Profitability   | ðŸ’¹         |
